        <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
        <p>SEO is the science of search engines. 
            Learning and predicting how an AI search algorithm.
            SEO stands for Search engine optimization. 
            People who practice this study can effectively outrank authoritative websites in only thirty-five weeks. 
            While once the big brands had the top ranks in google.    
            More and more computer nerds are learning how to outrank these companies with the simple art of SEO and a helpful blog.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is SEO important?</h2>
        <p>SEO is your undercover spy on your competitor's website. 
            This work breaks up in several different tasks you will have to do every week for all your content on your website. 
            This is to stay relevant in the google search engine.  
            Those who follow the right steps to the tea will succeed.
            </p>
        <h2>Code Development</h2>
        <p>Do not learn how to code if your planning to focus on SEO. 
            Leave the coding to the coders. 
            Try hiring a webmaster. 
            If you have the time, do so, but if you can work for the creative marketing team, that would be better.
            </p>
        <h2>KW's (Keywords)</h2>
        <p>KW's are stings of words that are fed into the google search algorithm to help it predict what users will ask before they finish typing it out. 
            It's fairly good scary enough. I almost never write out a query all the way through. 
            KW's are also used to have more insight into what people search on google.             
            Usually, if google auto suggest predict your search, it means your search is very relevant, believe it or not.            
            This is why SEO analysts tend to use KW's to write interesting blog posts.             
            It doesn't do much help if you write a blog no one is interested in.           
            Keywords analytics show you what topics people are interested in.
            KW's are also good to be used on H1, H2, H3, H4 and so on.            
            Use your KW's responsibly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When starting off its a good idea to use a free KW research tool.            
            Sites like,
            https://www.wordstream.com/KWs
            https://KWtool.io/
            https://semrush.com/ (Free version has some tools)           
            Giving you the edge over other similar businesses who know nothing about SEO.            
            You will be able to find KW's you would have never thought of.            
            Use these tools in conjunction with Google search predictions.             
            Writing something like “Nema enclosures” you start by going down a list of queries.             
            “Nema enclosures, Nema enclosure b, Nema enclosure c and so on.            
            Google will spit out a list of search terms relating to your product.             
            Now you know how to promote your website.
            </p>
        <h2>Long-tail KWs</h2>
        <p>KW's can be broad and excessive (these are usually called “head KWs”), or they can be more specific combinations of different terms - these are called “long-tail KWs. 
            ” KWs on there own might appear to be your ultimate goal as they often have temptingly high search volume.            
            However, you can expect to have an extremely hard time with your competition. 
            You may want your comic book shop to rank for “comics,” but it’s going to be tough to rank above Marvel and DC.
            </p>
        <h2>Google Page Insight</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of disputable ways to fix a website and have it rank higher. 
            You can try experimenting with KWs, writing exceptional blogs or captivating videos.             
            But one thing that can without a doubt cripple your website, is page speed. If you think about it rationally.            
            When we go to a website, we want to be delivered with the content we need fast or else we will back out of your site and move on to your competitor. 
            Page speed is determined by a lot of different factors.            
            If you could think of a website as a club and the elements are a line of people waiting outside for the page to start loading.            
            Every element on your page needs to be loaded individually.            
            Meaning you would have to set priority on what needs to be loaded first.            
            If you place a javascript element that is all the way at the end of the page, instead of the elements on your header, The user will be sitting there with nothing but a half-loaded javascript element at the end of the page.           
            This is what Google deems as bad user experience and can be a serious factor when trying to rank on top of your competitors.          
            If you think users care more about content over user experience you will be having a wakeup call soon.          
            There have been cases where the difference between ranking first and ranking fifth is page speed and nothing else.            
            Lucky for you, google page speed index is a free tool you can use to determine your page speed.             
            When looking at Google PageSpeed index, you will notice that Google is throwing a lot of information at you all at once.             
            Fear not, as there are only a few important sections that will be vital to the success of your page.             
            Follow this guide to learn more about SEO             
            The next lesson will be on Keyword Research.
